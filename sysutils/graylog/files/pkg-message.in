======================================================================

Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of graylog.conf, log4j.xml, and
and adjust them for your configuration.

For GeoIP support you need to install the net/GeoIP port and
configure the path to the GeoIP databases in the Graylog Web Interface.

When running graylog in a jail, you need to set enforce_statfs for the jail.

For a single-node installation, install:

- databases/mongodb36
- textproc/elasticsearch5

And ensure that the elasticsearch cluster name matches that used by graylog.
======================================================================

The locations for configuration files have changed to match upstream
versions, using %%ETCDIR%%/graylog.conf instead of server/server.conf.

You can either relocate your config files, or use rc.conf settings to
specify appropriate paths using graylog_config and graylog_log_config
for graylog.conf and log4j.xml respectively.
