Zig is an open-source programming language designed for robustness,
optimality, and maintainability, to compete with C and Rust.

It's entire syntax is a 500 line PEG grammar, with no hidden control
flow, suprise memory allocations, no preprocessor, and no macros.

It supports 4 build modes, across debug, speed, code size, and has its
own build system, and can optionally compile C code as well, to multiple
targets, including UEFI, Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and OSX, with or
without a libc as required.
